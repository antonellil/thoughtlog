#Feature ideas:

Daily aggregation by tags used
* Example - #workout 4.5 miles bike, 1.5 mile run, 12 rep 135, 
8 rep 185, 8 rep 205, 7 rep 225 bench, 3x8 lat pull downs 100 pulldown, 
3x8 bicep pulldowns, etc. then can do a day aggregation search for #workout 
or #lifting in a time period and quickly see all the days and workouts that 
were completed
* Example - #feedback for co-worker feedback and can easily get to last 6 months
